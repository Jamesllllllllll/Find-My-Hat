# Find Your Hat

## Project for Codecademy

This is a simple terminal game. Using direction keys, navigate through a field while avoiding holes to reach your "hat".

Building the game involved creating a **Field** class with two methods: 

- print() - prints the field with location of player, holes and hat. This is used to show player position after each turn.
- generateField(X, Y) - generates a field with holes, hat and player starting position.

This was a very satisfying project to complete. I learned about user input and got practice working with nested arrays. The player movement logic was easy, while the generateField method was challenging. It took a lot of trial and error to get it to correctly create the nested arrays, and then wrapping my head around how exactly to call the method to create a new field.
